/* About the firmware:
 *   
 * https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE

 */

 /* Making Changes
  * 
  * Edit the following files:
  * keyboard_config.h:  This file contains the Bluetooth definition as well as the Single/Left/Right configuration of your keyboard.
  * hardware_config.h:  This file contains the pin assignments for the keyboard and nRF52 module you use. 
  * keymap.cpp:         This file contains your keymap.  
  * keymap.h:           This file contains your keymap helper definitions and macros.
  * 
  * The folder "keyboards" contains a number of example config files you can copy to get started.
  */

  /* Required Software and Libraries
   * 
   * Follow the steps for the Adafruit NRF52 BSP
   * https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/arduino-bsp-setup
   * 
   */

   /* Compiling and Flashing
    * 
    * Once you have completed installing the required libraries, you should be able to compile and flash the firmware.
    * 
    * Board Selected:
    * Most nrf52832 based boards: Adafruit nRF52 Feather
    * Most nrf52840 based boards: PCA10056
    * Programmer: Bootloader DFU for BlueFruit nRF52
    * 
    * Note that for serial DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) you may need to manually press the "reset" button if the serial reset circuitry using the DTR line is not used.  
    * For PCA10056 boards, you may need to manually "double-reset" to put the board in DFU mode. 
    */

    /*  Flashing the Bootloader
     * 
     * In order to flash the bootloader and the Nordic Softdevice, you will need a j-link (SWD flasher)
     * The Adafruit library uses nrfutil; which in turns calls the j-link libraries from Segger.  
     * Segger manufactures the genuine J-link.  They also provide the j-link embedded in the Nordic nRF52832-DK.
     * The cheapest Genuine Segger J-link is the J-Link EDU Mini.
     * There are a number of chinese J-Link clones that may work with the j-link software your mileage may vary...
     * 
     * Required Bootloader: Depends on board you have.
     * 
     * Follow the instructions at Adafruit (link above) to download, install the necessary software
     * 
     * Other SWD programmers are available but other software will need to be used to flash the bootloader to the device.
     * Unless you have experience with these devices, we cannot recommend going with them if you are just starting out.
     * Such device include:
     * ST-Link V2 - OpenOCD
     * Black Magic Probe - arm-none-eabi-gdb
     * 
     * Refer to Joric's wiki for more information on flashing the bootloader using other tools
     * https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Bootloader
