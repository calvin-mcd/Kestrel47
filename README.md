collaboration with Falconloft\#4615

40s keyboard inspired by the TG4x. sandwich style case with midlayers case. Supports Bluetooth enabled micro controllers with use of this [power button](https://tech.alpsalpine.com/e/products/detail/SSSS811101/) as well as smd and throughhole style diodes.

Firmware for standard atmega & rp2040 pro micro style controllers is included.

## Todo

* [ ] fix BLE firmware

## Firmware

Firmware for both Atmega and rp2040 controllers is functional and included.

The BLE firmware is not yet confirmed to work. DO NOT USE.

~~The included BLE firmware requires Arduino IDE to compile correctly. See Nice!Nano and BlueMIcro documentation for details.~~
